Ansible configuration directory   -> /etc/ansible       /etc/ansible/hosts
2 primary ways to distribute commands:
1. Via Ad-hoc commands, which are stand-alone shell commands to be executed on all the ansible victims machines. Examples:
  ansible victims -a "whoami"        ansible victims -a "whoami" --become root

2. Via playbook scripts, these scripts must be in a .yml format and are run in this manner:
        ansible-playbook script.yml
