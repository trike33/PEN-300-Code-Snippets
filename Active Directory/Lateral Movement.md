(Although the techniques explained here aren't teached in the OSEP, I found them pretty useful during my OSEP exam & labs, learning and researching
about them also helped me improve my knowlegde of Active Directory which is always useful)

**PASS THE HASH:**
The pass-the-hash techinque allows an attacker to authenticate to remote systems using the user NTLM hash(the static part, also known as NT hash). 
Note that the pass-the-hash technique only applies to Windows/NTLM authentication and not to Kerberos authentication.

There are lots of tools that support pass-the-hash. For example all the impacket suite supports it, xfreerdp also does, mimikatz also does, and the
list keeps going on...

Passing the hash from bare bones *nix systems using [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit/tree/master).
