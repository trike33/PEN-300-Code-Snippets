One of the easiest ways to enumerate an Active Directory enviroment is using [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound) ingestor, and 
then viewing the results with [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound). 

Alternatively, you can use [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1) or windows built-in programs or with
PowerShell, however these methods are more time consuming and requires a great deep understanding of Active Directory enviroments.

ACLARATION: All the methods explained here, will provide you with the same information. A method being more diffuclt than other, doesn't directly correlates into
more or better information being gathered.
