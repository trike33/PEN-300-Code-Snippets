**Using BufWritePost:**

We can log the changes that have been made to a file using the VIM ":autocmd" command with the action "BufWritePost". Here are some other useful ones: VimEnter, VimLeave or FileAppendPre.

```
This code will log all of the files that the user is editing(this piece of code must be written into the .vimrc file or into another file like /tmp/settings.vim):

:autocmd BufWritePost * :silent :w! >> /tmp/vim_output_1.txt

```

```
This piece of code will only log the files that the user is editing as root(this piece of code must be written into the .vimrc file or into another file like /tmp/settings.vim):

:if $USER == "root"
:autocmd BufWritePost * :silent :w! >> /tmp/vim_output_2.txt
:endif
```
