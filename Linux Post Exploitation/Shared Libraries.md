**How do Shared Libraries work on linux:**

When a program runs, it searches for the libraries it needs to load under these routes and in these order:

```
1. RPATH application variable
2. LD_LIBRARY_PATH env varible
3. RUNPATH application variable
4. Direcotries under /etc/ld.so.conf
5. System libraries /lib, /lib64, /usr/lib, /usr/lib64, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64, and others
```
