I created this repository to serve me as a site to refer during my OSEP exam, so I tried to explain some theory, posible alternatives and most importantly to be able to exploit the vulns fast, since the OSEP exam enviroment its huge and you don't have that much time. I also tried to go deeper in what I personally consider the most important and relevant OSEP themes.

This repository contains the most important scripts that I wrote and used(with a little bit of theory) in the PEN-300 labs and during the OSEP exam.

This repository is for educational purposes only and all the scripts attached are provided without any form of warrannty.

Using this repository in the OSEP exam, I managed to get 13 flags(local.txt and proof.txt) plus the secret.txt, which do a total of 14 flags.
